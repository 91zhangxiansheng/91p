PicoRV32 SPI-Flash Demo
=======================

This is a simple PicoRV32 example design that can run code directly from an SPI
flash chip. This example design uses the Lattice iCE40-HX8K Breakout Board.

The flash is mapped to the memory region starting at 0x80000000. The reset
vector is set to 0x80100000, i.e. at the 1MB offset inside the flash memory.

A small scratchpad memory (default 256 words, i.e. 1 kB) is mapped to address
0x00000000. A simple GPIO controller is mapped to address 0xC0000000.

Run "make test" to run the test bench (and create testbench.vcd).

Run "make prog" to build the configuration bit-stream and firmware images
and upload them to a connected iCE40-HX8K Breakout Board.
